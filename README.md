# Flow Controller Scaffold for iOS Swift 3
Scaffold for a generic app using flow controllers. This includes a basic setup of:

- Startup Flow
- Welcome Flow
- Auth Flow
- Main Flow
- Stubs for additional flows

## Top Level Flows
These are the top level flows (they clear the main stack by default)

- Startup
- Auth
- Main

### Startup Flow
This is the initial flow at launch which checks for updates, notifications, stored credentials, etc...

### Auth Flow
Login or signup.

### Main Flow
The main application where the magic happens.
